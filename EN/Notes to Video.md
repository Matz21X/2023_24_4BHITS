# Notes "The Voluntourist"
#EN 

**Questions:**
1. The motifs of young people to do volunteering. 
2. The concerns / problems which are mentioned. 
3. Alternatives for people who really want to help.

**Answers:**
1. Looks good on the CV, to connect to the local people, to break away for a bit, it feels nice to share something with someone else, 
2. The farming project seems a bit odd. To start teaching kids without having any former teaching experience. Motives behind projects aren't humanitarian or charitable in any way. One of the major volunteer sending agencies made a profit of 3$ Million (selling poverty). There would be a better way to solve problems (pay locals to build buildings, train teachers directly...). Children get attached to the volunteers.
3.
