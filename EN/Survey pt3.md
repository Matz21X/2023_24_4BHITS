**Suggested measures**

It is recommended that the company adapts flexible work times. This could be achieved by letting the employees make their own timetable. Another benefit of flexible work times is the more stabilized work life balance of the employees and the possibility to work from home. The goal of better collaboration is reachable by implementing a global communication solution such as Microsoft Teams, or by dedicating rooms for collaborative work.
