**Application for a part-time job in the summer camp**

Dear Mrs. Smith,

I am writing to express my hight interest in your current opening for a part-time job in your summer camp. After researching the details of this position I am very excited to possibly work for you.

Myself is a 17 year-old student of the technical college in Hollabrunn and I see myself very suitable for this job. You advertisement specifies that you are looking for someone sporty with German and English language skills and being a bit of a handyman. I am more than happy to inform you that I check every single point of these requirements. 


It also is no problem for me to look after someone, I have plenty of experience working with youngsters. I have a little sister and have often looked after her.
