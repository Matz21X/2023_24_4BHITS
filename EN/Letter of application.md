**Application for a part-time job in the summer camp**

Dear Mrs. Smith,

I am writing to express my hight interest in your current opening for a part-time job in your summer camp. After researching the details of this position I am very excited to possibly work for you.

Myself is a 17 year-old student of the technical college in Hollabrunn and I see myself very suitable for this job. You advertisement specifies that you are looking for someone sporty with German and English language skills and being a bit of a handyman. I am more than happy to inform you that I check every single point of these requirements. 

German is my native language but I also speak English fluently. I visit the gym three times a week, so I believe I could call myself a bit of a sportsman. Arts and crafts are no problem either, my dad and I did plenty of projects at home such as a green roof for our terrace.
It also is no problem for me to look after someone although I do not have professional experience, I have a little sister and have often looked after her.

I would consider myself-hard working, patient and friendly.
